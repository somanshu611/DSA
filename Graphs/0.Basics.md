# Types of Graphs : 
## 1. Undirected
## 2. Directed

# Degree of a Vertex in a graph : 
- It is the number of vertices adjacent to a vertex V.
## 1. For Undirected Graph : 
- The formal definition stands here because there is are no directed edges in an undirected graph.
- ***Special Property*** : For Undirected graph total degree of all the nodes is basically twice of all the edges. 
- Total Degree = 2 X E 
## 2. For Directed Graph : 
-  For each vertex, there's two degrees : Indegree and Outdegree.
-  *Indegree* : No. of incoming edges 
-  *Outdegree* : No. of outcoming edges 

# Path in a graph
- Sequence of nodes or vertices such that none of the nodes are repeating or visited twice in that path. 

# Undirected Cyclic Graph : 
- Has cycle.
# Undirected Acyclic Graph : 
- Does not contain cycle.
- Can also be called tree. 
# Directed Cyclic Graph
-  
# Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)


# Weighted and Unweighted Graphs :
- Each vertex has a weight or does not. 
- Here too there will me more types according to whether directed or undirected, cycle or acyclic.
