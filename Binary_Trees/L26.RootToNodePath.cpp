// there's another variation to this problem called root to leaf path
// which can be implemented using this logic.

// Level Order Traversal felt very intuitive to me, and striver said the same thing.
// That other traversals can be a bit complicated and also you'll have to 
// explain your solution to the intervier you should choose a simple approach.
// Thus, before attempting any tree question thoroughly think about which
// traversal you gonna use.
