## Difference between Auxillary Space and Space Complexity  : 
- **Auxiliary Space** is the temporary space allocated by your algorithm to solve the problem, with respect to input size.

- **Space Complexity** is the total space used by your algorithm to solve the problem, with respect to input size. Note that the Space Complexity includes input size
