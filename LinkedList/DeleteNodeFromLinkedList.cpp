// https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/

// We are given access to nodes that we have to delete from the linked list. 
// So, whatever operation we want to do in the linked list, 
// we can operate in the right part of the linked list from the node to be deleted. 

// The approach is to copy the next nodeâ€™s value in the deleted node. 
// Then, link node to next of next node. 
// This does not delete that node but indirectly it removes that node from the linked list.

        node->val = node->next->val;
        node->next = node->next->next;
